      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently an auto insurance adjuster, and hoping to move into the tech field soon.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Farmersville, TX, which is about an hour and a half north of Dallas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Lately I've been spending a lot of time playing guitar. Most recently I started learning to sketch and draw.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Astronaut.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm currently in Allen, TX.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's something I've been interested in for a while, but the specific thing about web development that I'm interested in is it's ability to be done remotely. I'd like to live a semi-mobile life sometime in the future, and being able to work remotely would make that much easier.</p>
